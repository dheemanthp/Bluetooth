Delays while processing Data:
==============================
Radio signal processing
data buffering
encode/decode of the stream data. 


The audio data rate should be sufficiently smaller than usable bit rate on the Bluetooth link.
This is to allow retransmission schemes to reduce the effects of packet loss.
The profile does not exclude any "content protection method".
Countering the effects of such delays depends on implementation.
